This directory is intended to contain the main OS X executable module
and either the DP animation base directory (named "Ponies") or just a
symlink for it that leads outside the app bundle, to the neighbouring
"Ponies" directory. In this case, the bundle is treated as the single
executable, like in Linux or Windows branches of DPE.
